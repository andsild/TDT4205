\section*{Task 1}
See attached image. All arrows point to right/down unless drawn otherwise.

There is a shift-reduce conflict in state $I_{9}$ (from state $I_{0}$, recieve symbol E).
Here, a B can have two prodution rules; $B \rightarrow \cdot{}Bb$ and $E \rightarrow E\cdot{B}$.
The same is in state $I_{6}$ with production rules $B \rightarrow \cdot{Bb}$ and $D \rightarrow d\cdot{BEF}$.

\subsection*{Task 1b}
We augment the grammar by adding a production $A' \rightarrow A'$, such that the grammar has an accepting
end of input.

$
FOLLOW(A') \rightarrow \{\$\} \\                              
FOLLOW(A) \rightarrow \{\$\} \\                              
FOLLOW(B) \rightarrow \{\$, b, e\} \\                       
FOLLOW(D) \rightarrow \{\$\} \\                              
FOLLOW(E) \rightarrow \{b, c, f\} \\
FOLLOW(F) \rightarrow \{\$\} \\                     
$                                                              

In the automata there is no state with two or more terminating rules
(``dot placed to the far right'', e.g. $A \rightarrow \gamma{}\cdot$) where 
the follow set of both non-terminals have any shared element. Also, there are
no states where terminating rules are together with a nonterminating rule 
(dot is not to the far right). Therefore, there will be no conflict when 
making the SLR(1) table. Thus, the provided grammar is SLR(1).



\section*{Task 2}
Okay. My output seems to match the .tree.correct files (run checkCorrect.sh if you will)
